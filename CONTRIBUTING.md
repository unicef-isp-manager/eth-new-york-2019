# Contributing to Blocksolid

First off, thanks for being interested in providing internet to schools in Africa! 

If you are new to the project take a few minutes to read the [Wiki](https://github.com/unicef-isp-manager/eth-new-york-2019/wiki). 

Look through the existing [issues](https://github.com/unicef-isp-manager/eth-new-york-2019/issues). If you find one that you want to work on, leave a comment asking to be assigned to that issue. Start a work-in-progress(WIP) pull request. This will serve as the thread for discussion. Read [this article](https://ben.straub.cc/2015/04/02/wip-pull-request/) for more info.

If you want to report a bug please create a new issue and add the 'bug' label to it.

If you want to propose a new feature please do the same, but with the 'enhancement' label. Check first that the feature is not in the 'backlog' column of the [project board](https://github.com/unicef-isp-manager/eth-new-york-2019/projects) for that folder.
