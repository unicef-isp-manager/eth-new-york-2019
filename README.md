# Unicef Internet Service Provider monitoring

**Inspiration**
Children around the world lack the connectivity regions like North America and Western Europe have. This brings about huge information asymmetries that cause the region to lag behind in professional and workforce development. Therefore, in an effort to bring internet connectivity and empower people residing in developing regions we are building a dashboard that will allow Development workers on the ground and from abroad monitor the connectivity status of the region they are working with and provide accountability to local Internet Service Provider's and report connection outages.

**What it does**
Our dashboard will allow development workers on the ground to monitor the status of internet connectivity in specific regions across the world, automate the monthly internet payment to ISPs, monitor the general traffic of the sites that presently have internet access, validate the use of internet connectivity, and enable development workers to have a high level view of internet connectivity and enable providers to easily spot regions where they could expand to and provide critical information services to aid the population by providing them with access to information and prevent the spreading of disease and bring new tech skills to people across the regions served. Our platform also enables individuals to give donations for regions to have access to the internet and uses Smart Contracts that are connected to internet monitoring script with the data fed through chainlink to execute the Smart contract if the ISP has breached the contract

**How we built it**
We are using Smart Contracts with off-chain data fed through Chainlink into our Smart Contract (enabling execution if certain parameters are met)

**Challenges we ran into**
Script to monitor the internet connectivity. Version issues with web3.
